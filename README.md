# PolitiCritic Frontend

Web frontend for my team's contribution to HackGT 4 in October, 2017.

![PolitiCritic Landing Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31291920/45663808-68463780-bad6-11e8-9b27-99256390a917.png)

PolitiCritic scraped through a public social media profile and attempted to determine the political stance of the profile's owner. My responsibility as a team member was to create a simple web application through which users would interact with the custom API that another team member tasked himself with writing. After our presentation, the API was taken down from the servers hosting it, so PolitiCritic no longer functions. When it did, a decimal between -1 and 1 was displayed after a profile was analyzed, along with a "retry" button that refreshed the page. The decimal indicated PolitiCritic's best estimate as to the profile owner's political leanings, with -1 being extremely liberal, and 1 being extremely conservative.
