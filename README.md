# politicritic-frontend
Web frontend for my team's contribution to HackGT 4 in October, 2017.

PolitiCritic scraped through a public social media profile and attempted to determine the political stance of the profile's owner. My responsibility as a team member was to create a simple web application through which users would interact with the custom API that another team member tasked himself with writing. After our presentation, the API was taken down from the servers hosting it, so PolitiCritic no longer functions. When it did, a decimal between negative one and one was displayed after a profile was analyzed, along with a "retry" button that refreshed the page. The decimal indicated PolitiCritic's best estimate, with negative one being extremely liberal, and positive one being extremely conservative.
